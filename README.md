# This repo will be used to review for algorithms

# Good topics to go over
0. Arrays
    a. sliding window
    b. prefix sum
1. Linked Lists
    a. Reverse a Linked List
    b. sliding window 
    c. slow and fast pointer
2. Stacks/Queues
    a. Pattern: Stacks are used when you operate on a previous element immediately before the current element.
        i. 753 asteroid collision
        ii. Basic Calculator 2
3. Binary Trees
    a. Inorder traversal
    b. postorder traversal
    c. preorder traversal
    d. binary search trees
4. Heaps
5. Sorting
6. Binary search
7. Graphs
    a. bfs
    b. dfs
    c. reducing problem down to graph problem
8. Backtracking
    a. Tip: Think of the entire level at a time
        i. 131 Palindrome Partition
    a. 698 Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets
9. Dynamic programming
    a. we either include or exclude the nth element
        1. 0/1 knapsack
    b. If we knew the answer to all of the previous n- 1, then how do we sovle n?
        1. Longst increasing subsequence
        2. longest string chain
        3. 322 coin change
