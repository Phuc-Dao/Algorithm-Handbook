#### 1. Relative sort Array
* Tried to forcefully use a technique from another algorithm, resulted in an overly-complicated technique for an easy problem 
    * solution: overly-scrutinize every solution that you come up with to make sure it works
    * solution: Sometimes you might come up with a different approach to a similar problem, its ok just accept that and roll with it  
* Tried to prematurely optimize for space
    * solution: Come up with unoptimal space/time first
* Went down a rabbithole of the wrong technique, next time try to go breadth first
    * solution: At first don't sweat the details, think high-level first

#### 2. Number of dice rolls with target sum 
* Got this pretty good, but need to work on debugging dynamic programming questions

#### Python
* Use collections.Counter() to count things
* Sorted works on dictionaries

#### Dynamic programming
* It helps to write out every possible state when you are not sure what the recurrance relation is
* It helps to think of it in terms of the last step (burst balloons)
